# ðŸš‚ðŸš‚ðŸš‚ Trains ðŸš‚ðŸš‚ðŸš‚

Like [wttr.in](https://wttr.in/), but for UK trains!

## Example commands

Get my closest station (or Kings cross if you're outside the UK):

```sh
curl departures.tk
```

Get a specific station by its code:

```sh
curl departures.tk/kgx
```

If you access these from a browser, they'll redirect to the website
